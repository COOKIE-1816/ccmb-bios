# Build dependicences
It all depends on these packages to build:
* `avr-gcc` - C and C++ compiler for AVR microcontrollers
* `avr-libc` - C libraries for `avr-gcc`
* linux shell and fully working kernel

# Building from sources
1. Make sure you are using linux and your system statisfies build dependicences.  
2. Clone git repository and navigate to `ccmb-bios`.  
```shell
git clone https://github.com/COOKIE-1816/ccmb-bios.git
cd ccmb-bios 

# additionaly, you can download the zip file and extract its contents.
```
3. Run `buid.sh` script to build from sources.
```shell
bash ./build.sh
```
